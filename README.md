# Android_OCR_Recharger_BD
This is an android application for capturing the scratchcard hidden number and complete the recharge of your expected operator in Bangladesh. For the first time of your app running, you'll be required a internet connection for downloading some data file like tesseract-ocr from google and some more. 

I used the following link as reference:
                                      https://github.com/rmtheis/android-ocr

This is only for Bangladeshi Mobile network operators including:
                                      Banglalink, GrameenPhone, Teletalk, AirtelBD, Robi Axiata, Citycell

I'm inspired by one of my best friend Tomal (https://www.facebook.com/shahruk.tomal). I did it for you :). 

You'll be required the following libraries to build this application on Android Studio.
    1. google-api-translate-java-0.98-mod2.jar
    2. json_simple-1.1.jar
    3. jtar-1.0.4.jar
    4. microsoft-translator-java-api-0.6-mod.jar
